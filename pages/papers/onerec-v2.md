| Representation | Tokenization | Backbone | Training | Inference |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| `Text+Img+CF†` | `R-KM†` | **`Lazy Dec-Only`** | `Fixed / NTP → RL` | `Beam` |

- `Lazy Dec-Only`: A lazy decoder-only architecture that concentrates decoder computation on target generation.
- `Fixed`: SIDs are built first and not changed while the generator trains.
- `NTP → RL`: NTP, then reinforcement learning (GRPO, GBPO, etc.).
