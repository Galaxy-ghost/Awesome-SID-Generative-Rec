| Representation | Tokenization | Backbone | Training | Inference |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| `Text+Geo` | **`RQ-VAE`** | `Dec-Only` | `Fixed / Multi-task NTP` | `C-Beam` |

- `Dec-Only`: Decoder-only.
- `Fixed`: SIDs are built first and not changed while the generator trains.
- `Multi-task NTP`: The same NTP loss over several tasks.
- `C-Beam`: Constrained beam search.

### At a Glance

| Aspect | Summary |
| :-- | :-- |
| Research Problem | I. Informativeness: Do the SIDs, or the model reading them, carry the collaborative and multimodal signals recommendation needs? |
| Modified Stage | Tokenization |
