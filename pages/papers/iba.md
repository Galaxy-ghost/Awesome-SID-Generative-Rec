| Representation | Tokenization | Backbone | Training | Inference |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| `Text` | `RQ-VAE` | **`Enc-Dec`** | `Fixed / NTP → (NTP + Aux.)` | `C-Beam` |

- `Enc-Dec`: Encoder-decoder.
- `Fixed`: SIDs are built first and not changed while the generator trains.
- `NTP → (NTP + Aux.)`: Next-token prediction, followed by joint optimization of next-token prediction and auxiliary objectives.
- `C-Beam`: Constrained beam search.
